      <h1>Digital Transformation of Vietnam's Healthcare – The Journey to Modernize the Healthcare System</h1>
      <p>
        Vietnam is undergoing a comprehensive digital transformation in its healthcare sector, with the ambition of building a modern, intelligent, and efficient healthcare system. 
        From digitizing medical records to applying artificial intelligence (AI) in diagnosis, Vietnam is gradually asserting its new position in the region in medical technology, demonstrated through groundbreaking policies, extensive international cooperation, and strong investment in research – development (R&D).
      </p>
      <p>
        Digital transformation is no longer just a trend but a necessity to enhance the capacity of the healthcare system, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic – when data, connectivity, and technology proved their vital role in protecting public health. 
        Vietnam aims to transform its healthcare mindset and model, putting people at the center, data as the foundation, and technology as the driving force for development.
      </p>

      <div class="callout">
        <p><strong>The BIODAS Team</strong> synthesizes from official sources of the Ministry of Health and WHO, updating policies, results, and challenges in Vietnam's healthcare digital transformation journey to 2030.</p>

    <!-- 2. Policy Framework -->
    <section id="sec-2">
      <h2>2. Digital Health Transformation Policy Framework</h2>
      <p>
        The Vietnamese government has shown strong determination in modernizing the healthcare system through strategic policies. 
        <strong>Resolution No. 57-NQ/TW</strong> of the Politburo (2023) sets out a vision to 2030: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>To be among the top 50 countries in the world in terms of digital competitiveness;</li>
        <li>To be among the top 3 leading countries in Southeast Asia in research and development of artificial intelligence.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Digital Health Transformation Project for the period 2023–2025 concretizes this vision with 5 pillars: 
        data infrastructure development, digital health ecosystem, application of AI and Big Data, information security, and training of digital health human resources.
      </p>

      <div class="callout">
