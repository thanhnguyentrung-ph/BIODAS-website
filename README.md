This is the repo for the Positron website at <https://positron.posit.co/>.

This site is built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and the [Posit product documentation theme](https://github.com/posit-dev/product-doc-theme), and these educational materials are released under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). Positron™ and the Positron icon™ are trademarks of Posit Software, PBC. All rights reserved.

## Reporting issues

We currently use the issue tracker for [Positron](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron). Please report documentation bugs and feature requests at <https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues>.

## Linting

This project uses [Vale](https://vale.sh/docs/) for automated linting and compliance with the Posit style guide.

- If you are a Posit employee, you can find the "Posit Documentation Style Guide" on Confluence.
- If you are an external contributor, we as reviewers will take responsibility for compliance with the guidelines. Thank you for being willing to improve our docs!

Vale runs [via GH action on PRs](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron-website/actions/workflows/lint.yml), but you can also run it locally before you submit a PR if you have [installed Vale](https://vale.sh/docs/vale-cli/installation/) locally. Run `vale .` from the root directory of this project to lint the `.qmd` files used to build the site.

## Local development

If you have [Quarto installed locally](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) and Chrome or Edge, you can preview the site by running one of the Debug Configurations in VS Code or Positron.

The configurations run `quarto preview` and then open the site in a new browser window.
- **Preview Docs (Chrome)**: Preview the site in Chrome
- **Preview Docs (Edge)**: Preview the site in Edge

The site will re-render as you make changes to the `.qmd` files.

Alternatively, you can run the command `quarto preview` in the terminal.

## Managing execution and rendering

Some `.qmd` files used for our site involve executable code, like the `.qmd` files that creates <https://positron.posit.co/download> and <https://positron.posit.co/start>. We currently use the ["Local Execution with CI Rendering" option described in the Quarto docs](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/ci.html#rendering-for-ci), with the [freeze](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/code-execution.html#freeze) execution option to make it easier for us to collaborate together across the large number of pages. For now, if you need to update a page involving computations, be sure to render that page locally and check in the files created in the `_freeze` directory.
