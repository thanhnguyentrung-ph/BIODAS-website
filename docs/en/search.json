Background and Rationale\n      \n        In the context of digital transformation, data is increasingly regarded as a strategic resource. The effective use of data plays a central role in policy design and implementation, social governance, and sustainable development. International organizations such as FAO, ESCAP, and the UN have repeatedly emphasized the importance of data capacity in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n      \n      \n        However, the current situation in many developing countries, including Vietnam, shows a significant lack of skills in data processing and analysis within the community. Many officials, students, and social organizations only have basic access (e.g., basic Excel), while lacking the ability to use more modern tools (Power BI, R, Python, Quarto). This limits the ability to make evidence-based decisions and apply data in local governance.\n      \n\n      \n        Key international indicators:\n        \n          \n            Mačiulienė & Skaržauskienė (2019): civic tech communities \n            can only develop sustainably when they integrate three pillars: technology, knowledge, and people.\n          \n          \n            FAO (2020): in a project in Papua New Guinea emphasized that the lack of baseline data \n            hindered the development of agricultural policy; continuous training, a standardized data framework, \n            and the application of simple technology (CAPI, GIS) brought about a breakthrough.\n          \n          \n            ESCAP (2025): affirms that digital data governance \n            is a key factor in promoting the SDGs, and requires the active participation of the community.\n          \n        \n      \n\n      \n        From these gaps, the implementation of the project \"Building a foundation for community data processing and analysis capacity\" is both an urgent and long-term requirement in the process of building a digital society in Vietnam.\n      \n    \n    \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        Illustration (Source: Internet)\n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      2. Objectives\n\n      2.1 General Objective\n      \n        \n          To develop and validate a community data capacity platform model to enhance the skills, knowledge, and data application capabilities of community groups, thereby contributing to promoting sustainable development and digital transformation.\n        \n      \n\n      2.2 Specific Objectives\n      \n        \n          Survey and assess the current state of community data capacity in Vietnam.\n          \n            Design a multi-tiered training program (basic - advanced - applied) based on the following tools: \n            Excel/Power Query/Power Pivot, Power BI, Stata, R/RMarkdown/RShiny, Quarto/Positron, basic Python.\n          \n          \n            Develop an open educational resource system (bilingual Vietnamese - English) with sample datasets that are practical and easy to access.\n          \n          \n            Establish Community Data Labs to create a space for practice, collaboration, and data-driven innovation.\n          \n          \n            Develop and validate a community data literacy maturity model \n            (Community Data Literacy Maturity Model).\n          \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      3. Research Questions\n\n      \n        \n          What is the current state of community data capacity in Vietnam and where are the main gaps?\n          Which data analysis tools are most suitable for the needs, level, and resources of the community?\n          Can the Community Data Labs model become a sustainable mechanism for enhancing and maintaining community data capacity?\n          How can we measure the progress of data capacity at both the individual and community levels?\n          Can this model be integrated with international programs (SDGs, FAO, ESCAP) to enhance its impact and scalability?\n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        Illustration (Source: Internet)\n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      4. Theoretical Basis and Analytical Framework\n\n      \n        Theoretical Basis\n        \n          \n            Civic tech & digital data analytics framework (Mačiulienė & Skaržauskienė, 2019):\n            three main networks – Tech/Media, Knowledge, and Human – are the basis for understanding how\n            communities interact and develop data capacity.\n          \n          \n            Community capacity (Liberato et al., 2011):\n            includes skills development, resource mobilization, network building, leadership, and participatory decision-making;\n            can be adapted to measure data capacity.\n          \n          \n            Papua New Guinea experience (FAO, 2020):\n            emphasizes the role of baseline data, simple but effective technology, and continuous training\n            in enhancing national data capacity.\n          \n          \n            Digital data governance (ESCAP, 2025):\n            requires data to be governed transparently, accountably, and sustainably, directly linked to the SDGs.\n          \n        \n      \n\n      \n        Research Analytical Framework\n        \n          Inputs: tools, learning materials, training programs.\n          Process: operation within Community Data Labs, where data is collected, processed, analyzed, and shared.\n          Outputs: enhanced individual and community data capacity.\n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      5. Approach\n\n      \n        Mixed-Methods Approach\n        \n          Combines quantitative surveys (measuring data capacity before and after intervention) and qualitative methods\n          (interviews, group discussions) to both quantify the level of change and explain the mechanisms and context of the impact.\n        \n      \n\n      \n        Implementation Activities\n        \n          Implement the Community Data Labs model in a test-evaluate-adjust cycle,\n          ensuring continuous improvement based on experimental feedback from learners and the community.\n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        Illustration (Source: Internet)\n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      6. Expected Outcomes\n\n      \n        \n          \n            Enhanced individual capacity: at least 1,000 learners participate in the project and receive training,\n            of which 200 achieve an advanced certificate.\n          \n          \n            Strengthened community capacity: a minimum of 10 community projects apply data\n            to address priority social issues.\n          \n          \n            Sustainable institution: establishment of an independently operating Community Data Labs.\n          \n          \n            Open educational resource system: publication of bilingual materials (Vietnamese - English), sample datasets, and practical guides,\n            that are easy to access and reuse.\n          \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to topReferences\n      References\n\n      \n        1) FAO.

Introduction\n      \n        The review article \n        \n          \n            “Considering Biased Data as Informative Artifacts in AI-Assisted Health Care”\n          \n         \n        by Kadija Ferryman (Johns Hopkins University), Maxine Mackintosh (Genomics England), \n        and Marzyeh Ghassemi (MIT), published in The New England Journal of Medicine (2023), \n        presents a new perspective on medical data in the age of artificial intelligence (AI).\n      \n\n      \n        Instead of viewing biased data as “technical garbage” to be discarded according to the \n        “garbage in – garbage out” principle, the authors argue that these very biases \n        are “informative artifacts” — reflecting \n        the values, practices, and inequalities deeply embedded in the modern healthcare system. \n        Viewing data as “social relics” can help us better understand \n        how technology reflects and sometimes amplifies injustice in healthcare.\n      \n\n      \n        This perspective suggests that instead of just trying to “fix” the data, \n        the scientific community needs to learn to “read” them — much like archaeologists interpret artifacts \n        to understand ancient societies. Clinical data, when viewed as a type of “artifact,” \n        can reveal much about hospital organization, professional culture, and how society values \n        health and human worth.\n      \n\n      \n        \n          The BIODAS Team presents this overview to encourage critical thinking about \n          how data and algorithms shape health equity. By understanding the origins of bias, \n          we can transform AI from a predictive tool into a tool for detecting health inequalities.\n        \n      \n\n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        Illustrative image (Source: https://www.nejm.org)\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      2. The Problem\n      \n        In modern healthcare, AI systems are almost entirely dependent on \n        massive, labeled datasets. When this data reflects differences \n        in race, gender, or socioeconomic status, AI can inadvertently \n        reproduce social biases — a phenomenon known as \n        algorithmic discrimination.\n      \n\n      \n        \n          For example, in a study of chest X-rays, an AI system trained on thousands of images \n          still showed a tendency for underdiagnosis in Black and \n          Hispanic patients, especially women. This happened because \n          the original data did not fairly reflect the disease prevalence in these populations.\n        \n      \n\n      \n        According to Ferryman and colleagues, the problem is not just that the data is “wrong,” but also how we understand it. \n        Clinical data is a product of social context, organizational processes, and professional decisions; \n        therefore, each “bias” is an indicator of the culture and history of the medical field. \n        Instead of eliminating them, we can learn from these biases to improve health equity.\n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        Illustrative image (Source: https://www.quantib.com)\n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      3. Three Key Aspects: When Data Becomes an \"Artifact\"\n\n      3.1. Data and Social Values\n      \n        \n          “Race correction” in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was once considered a scientific improvement, \n          but it actually reflected the assumption that Black people have higher muscle mass – a legacy from a time \n          when the white male body was considered the “biological norm.” \n          When these formulas are incorporated into AI, they continue to reproduce racial stereotypes \n          under the neutral guise of an algorithm.\n        \n        \n          Viewed from an “artifact” perspective, the existence of “race correction” variables is not just a statistical error, \n          but a trace of a historical period when medical science was built on a foundation of racial discrimination. \n          Acknowledging and analyzing the origins of these “hidden values” is the first step \n          towards more responsible medical AI.\n        \n      \n\n      3.2. Data and Clinical Practice\n      \n        \n          Many electronic health records lack data on gender identity, disability status, or social factors. \n          This “data absence” is not merely a technical error, \n          but reflects a lack of uniformity in medical language, barriers of trust between doctors and patients, \n          and limitations in training healthcare workers on gender diversity. \n          According to the authors, if we approach this from an “artifact” perspective, we can use AI \n          to identify where data is missing, thereby raising questions about equity and representation in healthcare.\n        \n        \n          AI, when used correctly, can detect “data gaps” — \n          such as the lack of data for minority ethnic groups or LGBTQ+ patients — \n          and turn them into signals for deeper research into systemic inequalities.\n        \n      \n\n      3.3. Data and Health Inequalities\n      \n        \n          In the field of lung cancer, data shows that Black patients are often diagnosed later than white patients, \n          causing AI to “learn” that this group has a worse prognosis. \n          Without considering the social context, the AI model will reinforce the very injustices it should be correcting. \n          By treating data as an artifact, researchers can detect and clarify \n          the systemic chains of exclusion in healthcare, such as lack of access to \n          early screening services, high treatment costs, or biases in the disease classification process.\n        \n      \n\n      \n        “Medical data doesn't just talk about patients – it talks about the entire care system and what society values.”\n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      4. A Sociotechnical Approach\n      \n        Ferryman and colleagues propose an analytical framework that combines technology, ethics, and society, \n        aiming to broaden the understanding of data bias. Instead of just “patching” technical errors, \n        they suggest a more comprehensive approach that combines data, people, and social context.\n      \n\n      \n        \n          Beyond “data cleaning”: Not just removing biases, but interpreting the socio-historical reasons behind the data.\n          Interdisciplinary collaboration: Connecting doctors, engineers, ethicists, and sociologists to co-create solutions.\n          Aligning with health equity: Viewing AI not just as a disease detection tool, but as a tool for detecting inequality.\n        \n      \n\n      \n        This approach moves AI beyond the realm of “pure technology,” \n        towards a more reflective and humanistic development model. \n        It also opens up the opportunity to use AI as a sociological tool to illuminate the very unjust structures \n        that the data reflects.\n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        Illustrative image (Source: https://www.wsp.com)\n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      5. Application in Vietnam\n      \n        In the context of Vietnam building a national health data infrastructure and implementing electronic health records, \n        the “data as artifact” mindset is particularly meaningful:\n      \n\n      \n        \n          It helps assess potential biases in health data, from regional to gender and economic conditions.\n          It lays the foundation for a data ethics framework and transparent policies when applying AI in public health.\n          It encourages collaboration between medicine, data science, and social sciences to ensure health equity.\n        \n      \n      \n      \n        National projects such as electronic health records, vaccination data, or disease forecasting systems \n        need to be designed with this socio-technical awareness. \n        Paying attention to data biases (e.g., underrepresentation of patients in remote areas or ethnic minorities) \n        can help prevent the reproduction of inequalities in digital health.\n      \n      \n        Identifying bias is not about discarding data, but about gaining a deeper understanding of the system that produced it — thereby creating sustainable health equity.\n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      6. Conclusion\n      \n        “Data bias” is not just a technical error – it is a mirror reflecting history, culture, and social structures. \n        By viewing data as “informative artifacts,” we can use AI to illuminate hidden inequalities, \n        instead of inadvertently reinforcing them. \n      \n      \n        This is the shift from “accurate AI” to “equitable AI” — \n        a necessary direction to ensure that technological progress is always linked to humanism and justice in digital medicine. \n        As Ferryman and colleagues conclude, “a medical AI system is only truly intelligent when it understands the history and human values hidden in the data it learns from.”\n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      7.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a powerful transformative force, promising to revolutionize the way clinical trials are designed, \n        conducted, and monitored.[1] The emergence of AI in clinical trials is not merely the application of new technology \n        but represents a fundamental shift in the approach to medical research.\n      \n\n      \n        \n          The BIODAS Team is pleased to present this overview to provide a comprehensive look at \n          patient recruitment & stratification, adaptive trial design, real-time monitoring, and automated reporting using AI;\n          while integrating practical examples and applications to optimize efficiency and minimize risks throughout the entire trial lifecycle.\n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      1. AI Revolutionizing Clinical Trials\n      \n        AI is reshaping the entire clinical trial lifecycle – from design, recruitment, data collection to monitoring and reporting. \n        Instead of replacing humans, AI acts as a capacity-enhancing tool, supporting researchers in making faster, more accurate decisions and minimizing manual errors.\n      \n      \n        The application of AI not only helps streamline processes but also brings strategic improvements in drug development. \n        Thanks to its ability to learn from vast amounts of data, AI can predict clinical events, optimize trial duration, detect problems early, and ensure compliance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) standards.\n      \n      \n        According to a McKinsey report (2025), pharmaceutical companies applying AI in trial design and management can save 15–25% in costs and shorten research time by an average of 8–12 months. \n        This not only helps accelerate the drug launch timeline but also reduces risks for patients participating in the trial.\n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n      \n      Illustrative image (Source: https://emag.medicalexpo.com)\n    \n\n    \n    \n      2. Patient Recruitment and Stratification\n      \n        Patient recruitment and stratification are among the most difficult and costly stages in clinical research. \n        On average, over 80% of trials fail due to slow or incorrect patient recruitment. \n        AI can help analyze millions of electronic health records (EHRs), genetic data, and population records to quickly identify patients who fit the study criteria.\n      \n\n      \n        Machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms help extract unstructured data from medical records, \n        automatically identifying patients at high risk or with characteristics suitable for the trial criteria. \n        This helps speed up recruitment, reduce costs, and limit bias in the study population.[2]\n      \n\n      \n        \n          Digital Twins – \"digital replicas\" of patients – allow for the simulation of individual responses to specific treatments. \n          This technology is being tested in diseases such as lung cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease to predict treatment efficacy before conducting actual trials. \n          Initial results show that the model's accuracy reaches 85–90% compared to actual results.\n        \n      \n\n      \n        In addition, AI can identify regions and hospitals with the potential for rapid patient recruitment, minimizing study start-up time. \n        A study from Lindus Health shows that applying AI in identifying research sites can increase recruitment speed by 30% and reduce monitoring costs by 20%.\n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n      \n      Illustrative image (Source: https://essentracomponents.bynder.com)\n    \n\n    \n    \n      3. Adaptive Trial Design and Protocol Optimization\n      \n        Designing a research protocol is a fundamental step that determines the success of a clinical trial. \n        Previously, research teams often spent months building and refining the protocol, \n        while many risks (such as unrealistic criteria or an inappropriate sample size) were only discovered after the study had started. \n        AI helps overcome this through AI-powered Protocol Design – an automated protocol generation tool.[5]\n      \n\n      \n        Tools like Medidata AI or Quanticate SmartTrial use data from thousands of previous trials to propose optimal study structures, outcome criteria, and sample sizes. \n        As new data is added, the AI model can \"learn\" and suggest real-time protocol adjustments – the foundation of adaptive trial design.\n      \n      \n        A typical example is in the COVID-19 trial, where the FDA applied a machine learning algorithm to identify a group of patients with high suPAR levels to optimize the treatment efficacy of the drug Anakinra. \n        This is a clear demonstration of how AI can directly improve clinical research outcomes and the licensing decision-making process.\n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n      \n      Illustrative image (Source: https://www.medidata.com)\n    \n\n    \n    \n      4. Real-time Data and Quality Monitoring\n      \n        Data monitoring is a critical task to ensure integrity, accuracy, and compliance in research. \n        Traditional monitoring systems often detect discrepancies after the data has been entered into the server, \n        causing delays and costs in the error correction process. \n        AI helps shift this process to a \"proactive real-time monitoring\" model.[6]\n      \n\n      \n        \n          Automated Anomaly Detection: Compares current data with historical data samples to identify discrepancies early.\n          CRF Form Optimization: AI suggests reorganizing data entry fields to reduce duplication and errors by research coordinators.\n          Data Query Prediction: Deep learning models can predict entry errors before they affect statistical results.\n        \n      \n\n      \n        A typical example is the monitoring system of LookDeep Health, which applies computer vision to monitor patient behavior in real time. \n        This technology allows for the identification of fall risks, procedural deviations, or physiological abnormalities in hospital-based trials.\n      \n      \n        As a result, researchers can intervene early, ensure safety, and minimize research interruptions, \n        while generating more reliable data for post-hoc analyses.\n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n      \n      Illustrative image (Source: https://itdigest.com)\n    \n\n    \n    \n      5. Automation of Clinical Study Reports (CSR)\n      \n        The Clinical Study Report (CSR) is a mandatory document when submitting data to regulatory agencies such as the FDA or EMA. \n        Compiling hundreds of tables and statistical analyses often takes weeks of work. \n        However, AI has helped transform this entire process through natural language processing (NLP) and Document AI tools.[Credevo]\n      \n\n      \n        \n          Automated Drafting: NLP extracts data from statistical tables, charts, and analysis software to automatically generate content for the efficacy, safety, and patient distribution sections.\n          Consistency Check: AI cross-references the Protocol, Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), and CSR to detect discrepancies in definitions or figures.\n          Automated Formatting: Systems like SmartDocs or eCTD Builder ensure that documents meet FDA/EMA standards without manual adjustments.\n        \n      \n\n      \n        Automating the CSR helps reduce report preparation time by 50–70% and significantly improves document accuracy. \n        Furthermore, research teams can focus on scientific analysis instead of administrative tasks, \n        thereby accelerating the entire \"database lock – submission\" cycle.\n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n      \n      Illustrative image (Source: https://www.sciencepharma.com)\n    \n\n    \n    \n      6. Challenges and Limitations\n      \n        Although AI offers many benefits, its implementation in clinical trials still faces major challenges:\n      \n\n      \n        \n          Data Quality: AI algorithms are heavily dependent on training data; incomplete or biased data can lead to biased predictions.\n          Regulation and Ethics: Transparency, explainability, and protection of personal information must be ensured.\n          Regulatory Acceptance: The FDA and EMA are still in the process of establishing a formal legal framework for \"AI-assisted trials.\"\n          Infrastructure Connectivity: Integrating AI into EDC, LIMS, and CTMS systems requires unified data standards (CDISC, HL7 FHIR).\n        \n      \n\n      \n        Despite these barriers, the trend of \"AI-driven clinical research\" is irreversible. \n        In the next 5 years, AI systems are expected not only to support but also to become a mandatory component in the management and analysis of clinical trials, \n        helping to elevate medical research to be more precise and sustainable.\n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n      \n      Illustrative image (Source: https://nextgeninvent.com)\n    \n\n    \n    \n      7. Conclusion and Future Prospects\n      \n        Artificial intelligence is fundamentally changing the way clinical trials are designed, implemented, and managed. \n        From patient recruitment, protocol optimization, data monitoring to automated reporting, AI has demonstrated its ability to \n        shorten research time, increase accuracy, reduce costs, and enhance the scientific reliability of the entire process.\n      \n\n      \n        In the next decade, the combination of AI, Big Data, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), and Precision Medicine \n        will usher in a new era – where trials are no longer static, but become flexible, adaptive, and personalized learning systems. \n        Machine learning models can predict disease progression, suggest optimal patient groups, and even automatically adjust research protocols based on real-time data.\n      \n\n      \n        Three prominent trends by 2030:\n        \n          \n            1. Clinical Trials 4.0 – Automation and Open Data: \n            Clinical trials will gradually become a fully digitized process, integrating data from wearable devices, electronic health records, and remote monitoring systems. \n            AI will play a central role in standardizing, integrating, and analyzing this data for rapid decision-making.\n          \n          \n            2. Virtual & Decentralized Trials (DCT): \n            Decentralized Clinical Trials will become more common thanks to AI-powered remote monitoring, \n            data validation, and maintenance of patient-researcher interaction without face-to-face meetings.\n          \n          \n            3. AI-Governed Trial Intelligence: \n            In the future, AI systems will take on the role of \"coordinating intelligence\" – monitoring research progress, forecasting risks, \n            optimizing costs, and ensuring compliance with global legal regulations (FDA, EMA, PMDA...).\n          \n        \n      \n\n      \n        For Vietnam, the application of AI in clinical trials is still in its early stages, but the potential is enormous. \n        Research centers, hospitals, and universities can start by building standardized data management systems (CDISC, HL7-FHIR) \n        and investing in computational infrastructure – essential foundations for AI-based research. \n        Along with training a multidisciplinary workforce (medicine – data science – biomedical ethics), \n        Vietnam can gradually move towards participating in the global trial network, contributing to the new era of precision medicine.\n      \n\n      \n        Finally, AI is not just a supportive technology – it is a tool that shapes new scientific thinking. \n        With the combination of human intelligence and the power of machine learning, future clinical trials will not only be \"smarter\" but also \"more humane\" – \n        aiming for the ultimate goal: improving the quality of life and ensuring patient safety worldwide.\n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      8.

Introduction\n      \n        Artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is no longer a foreign concept, but how it is implemented and the level of patient acceptance remain open questions. Although AI has been studied in healthcare since the 1970s, the real boom has only occurred in the last few decades with the potential to improve prognosis, reduce costs, and enhance the quality of care for both doctors and patients. As a multidisciplinary field, AI is gradually becoming a pillar of a patient-centered healthcare system.\n      \n      \n        For cancer patients, specific challenges include the lack of continuous personalized care, and patients often experience anxiety and uncertainty. These anxieties are further exacerbated in linguistic, ethnic, and racial minority groups - vulnerable communities in society. AI applications have shown positive results in mitigating these challenges while aiming to improve quality of life. However, the level of acceptance and adoption of AI by cancer patients is still not well understood.\n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        Illustration (Source: xsolis.com)\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      2. Research Methods\n      \n        The study “Acceptance and Adoption of Artificial Intelligence Among Cancer Survivors Seeking Information: A Literature Review” by Prabal Chourasia et al. (2025), published in the Journal of Patient Experience, conducted a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines on three main databases: PubMed, Scopus, and CINAHL Plus with Full Text.\n      \n      \n        Inclusion criteria:\n        \n          Studies surveying people aged 18–99;\n          Focusing on cancer patients;\n          Assessing the acceptance or adoption of AI in seeking medical information;\n          Being original research.\n        \n      \n      \n        Exclusion criteria:\n        \n          Special patient populations (children, pregnant women...);\n          Studies focusing on service providers instead of patients;\n          Studies not about cancer patients or just conference abstracts.\n        \n      \n      \n        The analysis process used a combination of inductive and deductive methods to identify factors of trust in AI, the usability of AI tools, and the role of personalization.\n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      3. Research Results\n      \n      \n      \n        \n          \n        \n        \n          Acceptance and Adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) by Cancer Patients in Information Seeking (Prabal Chourasia, 2025)\n        \n      \n\n      \n        After screening 858 documents and removing duplicates, the research team analyzed 581 articles and selected 12 suitable studies.

The Importance of Biomedical Data Science: The Driving Force of Modern Medical Transformation\n      Introduction\n      \n        In the era of the digital revolution, medicine is undergoing a powerful transformation — from relying on clinical experience and personal intuition to a model based on data evidence.\n      \n      \n        The explosion of data in the medical and biological fields, from genomics, proteomics to electronic health records (EHR), poses a challenge: how to transform this huge amount of data into valuable knowledge for patient care.\n      \n      \n        The answer lies in Biomedical Data Science — an interdisciplinary field that harnesses big data to drive innovation and biomedical discovery. [1]\n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      2. A New Approach in Medicine\n      \n        Biomedical data science is not just about applying technology to medicine, but a completely new approach to understanding and solving complex problems in healthcare.\n      \n      \n        As researchers at Wake Forest School of Medicine have noted, we are living in an era of huge and diverse data — but the challenge is not just in collecting, but also in assessing the quality and reliability of the data.\n      \n      \n        This requires the development of skills and thinking in biomedical data analysis to be able to work effectively in the era of big data.\n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      3. Central Role in Basic Research [3]\n      \n        The importance of biomedical data science is clearly demonstrated by the legacy of the Human Genome Project (HGP), a revolutionary milestone that transformed modern biology through the model of “integrated big science”.\n      \n\n      \n        \n          \n        \n        \n          Illustration (Source: HGP-NIH)\n        \n      \n\n      \n        The impact of the HGP is profound and multidimensional. The sequencing of the genomes of microorganisms, plants, and animals has revolutionized many scientific fields, from microbiology, virology, infectious diseases to genetics.\n      \n      \n        Thanks to the ability to sequence the DNA of cancer cells and compare it with data from the HGP, scientists can identify mutated genes, thereby improving the understanding of genetic diseases and developing targeted therapies.\n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      4. Transforming the Clinical Model Through Learning Health Systems [4][6]\n      \n        In the clinical field, biomedical data science is promoting a new model called Learning Health Systems (LHS).\n      \n      \n        Collecting data from routine clinical practice;\n        Analyzing data to extract new knowledge;\n        Translating that knowledge back into practice to improve patient care.\n      \n      \n        This model represents a shift from “slow evidence” to “living evidence,” helping the healthcare system to learn and adapt continuously based on real-world data.\n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        Image: The learning cycle from data, knowledge to practice (Source: www.cambridge.org)\n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      5. Revolutionizing Diagnosis Through Artificial Intelligence [5]\n      \n        One of the most prominent applications of biomedical data science is medical imaging diagnosis using AI.\n        A recent meta-analysis of 83 studies showed that some generative AI models have diagnostic performance comparable to non-specialist physicians — with a difference of only 0.6% in accuracy.\n      \n      \n        This opens up great prospects in supporting diagnosis in areas with a shortage of medical personnel, while emphasizing the potential of AI in expanding access to healthcare.\n      \n\n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n        Illustration (Source: Internet)\n      \n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      6. Challenges and Limitations\n      \n        Data quality: Inaccurate, incomplete, or outdated data can lead to analytical biases and risks for patients.\n        Ethics and privacy: The collection, sharing, and use of medical data must strictly adhere to the principles of information governance, fairness, transparency, and accountability.\n        Human resources capacity: Requires a team with interdisciplinary knowledge of medicine, statistics, informatics, and data ethics.\n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      7. Conclusion\n      \n        Biomedical data science has become a pillar of modern medicine.\n        From decoding the human genome to developing learning health systems, this field creates a synergy that helps solve many complex medical problems.\n      \n      \n        Although there are still many challenges, the potential to improve treatment outcomes and reduce healthcare costs is undeniable.\n        Continuous investment in research, data infrastructure, and international cooperation will be key to maximizing the potential of biomedical data science in the future.\n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      8.

Traditional biomarkers are divided into seven groups depending on the clinical goal (e.g., safety, predictive, diagnostic, etc.). The study suggests that digital technologies open up the possibility of measuring digital biomarkers, which offer new and unique properties (such as continuous measurement over time) while still addressing the same clinical goals as traditional biomarkers.

Introduction\n      \n        Artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the approach to diagnosis and clinical decision-making. \n        However, most models are evaluated based on output accuracy, \n        while clinical reasoning – the process of analysis and inference leading to a diagnosis – \n        is the core value of medicine.\n      \n      \n        Clinicopathological Conferences (CPCs), \n        initiated by Dr. Richard Cabot in 1923 at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), \n        are where experts present, argue, and defend diagnoses based on real patient case data.  \n        After a century, NEJM has published over 7,000 CPC cases – an invaluable data repository describing how humans think in medicine.  \n        The Harvard team realized that this was the foundation for building a generation of AI that could reason like a real doctor.\n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        Image: Overview of CPC-Bench and Dr. CaBot (Source: arXiv (2025). DOI: 10.48550/arXiv.2509.12194)\n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      4. Research Methods\n      \n        Collected 7,102 CPC cases (1923–2025) and 1,021 NEJM Image Challenges (2006–2025).\n        Built CPC-Bench – a benchmark consisting of 10 medical tasks (diagnosis, testing, literature search, imaging...).\n        Data was annotated and validated by 10 internists (5 residents, 5 attending physicians).\n        Developed the Dr. CaBot system based on the OpenAI o3 model, \n            capable of finding similar cases, simulating the writing style of CPC experts, \n            and generating conference videos using LaTeX Beamer + TTS-HD.\n        Compared with 20 internists and conducted a “blind” test to evaluate the human-likeness of the AI.\n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      5. Key Results\n      \n        \n          OpenAI o3 achieved Top-1 = 60%, Top-10 = 84%, \n          far surpassing the physician group (24% and 45%). The accuracy of selecting appropriate tests reached 98%.  \n          In the “blind” test, 74% of physicians mistook the AI for a human – \n          and even rated Dr. CaBot higher for reasoning and educational appeal.\n        \n      \n\n      \n        \n          In imaging, Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved 84%, o3 achieved 82%, and GPT-4o achieved 75%.  \n          However, AI is still weak in X-rays and histopathology (55–67%).  \n          When analyzing the history of CPCs over 100 years, the team discovered a shift in pathology: \n          from 56% infectious diseases (1920s) to 68% cancer (1950s), \n          and Dr. CaBot achieved comparable – even slightly better – performance than human experts in the 2000–2010 period.\n        \n      \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n      6. Discussion\n      \n        \n          The results show that large language models (LLMs) not only reproduce information but also reproduce medical thinking.  \n          CPC-Bench has become a standardized measure, helping the scientific community track the progress of AI in clinical diagnosis.  \n        \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          Dr. CaBot promises to become a powerful teaching tool in medical education, \n          where learners can discuss directly with AI, learn how to form hypotheses, and perform multi-level reasoning.  \n          However, the Harvard team notes that AI still needs to improve its ability to search literature, process images, \n          and adhere to ethical standards and patient data privacy.\n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      7. Conclusion\n      \n        From Dr. Richard Cabot of the 20th century to Dr. CaBot of the 21st century, \n        the century-long journey of CPCs has come full circle between humans and artificial intelligence.  \n        Dr. CaBot demonstrates that AI not only provides answers, \n        but also understands and explains clinical thinking – the foundation of the medical profession.  \n      \n      \n        \n          “Dr. CaBot does not replace doctors, but demonstrates the collaboration between humans and machines in the journey of understanding medicine.”  \n          — Harvard Medical School research team\n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      References\n      \n        Buckley T.A. et al.

Introduction\n      \n        The article \n        \n          \n            “Medical AI and Clinician Surveillance — The Risk of Becoming Quantified Workers”\n          \n         \n        was published in The New England Journal of Medicine on June 19, 2025, \n        by authors I. Glenn Cohen (Harvard Law School), Ifeoma Ajunwa (Emory Law School), and Ravi B. Parikh (Emory University School of Medicine).\n      \n\n      \n        The article warns that as artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more deeply integrated into medicine, \n        tools designed to assist doctors could inadvertently turn them into \n        “quantified workers” — \n        that is, subjects of surveillance, measurement, and control of their work behavior through data and algorithms. \n        From an ethical and legal perspective, this is an emerging issue in the digital medicine era, where the professional autonomy \n        and clinical freedom of doctors could be gradually eroded.\n      \n\n      \n        \n          The authors argue that medicine needs to learn lessons from other industries where the application of AI has led to \n          reduced autonomy, increased surveillance, and worse working conditions. \n          Without immediate action, doctors could become “quantified” within the very healthcare system they serve.\n        \n      \n\n      \n      \n        \n          \n        \n        \n          Illustrative image (Source: https://www.aimsplatform.io)\n        \n      \n\n      \n        \n          The BIODAS Team is pleased to present this overview to provide a comprehensive perspective on \n          artificial intelligence (AI) in the surveillance and evaluation of healthcare workers — a topic that is reshaping the relationship between \n          technology, ethics, and the professional rights of doctors in the digital medicine era. \n          The article summarizes the main warnings and recommendations from the New England Journal of Medicine (2025), \n          helping readers better understand the risks and coping strategies as AI becomes more deeply involved in clinical practice.\n        \n      \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n      2. General Context\n      \n        In many labor sectors today, especially in logistics, finance, and technology, \n        workers are already working under the supervision of “mechanical managers” — \n        AI systems that track operations, behavior, location, and work performance in real time (1).  \n        Although medicine is considered a highly humanistic field, the rapid development of AI \n        is causing clinical professional activities to gradually fall into a similar trajectory.\n      \n      \n        Medical AI systems were initially developed with positive goals such as reducing administrative burdens, \n        increasing accuracy, and standardizing care processes. However, as the data analysis \n        and natural language processing (NLP) capabilities of AI become more powerful, these tools \n        can be repurposed to evaluate performance and control doctor behavior — \n        sometimes beyond their original purpose.\n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        Illustrative image (Source: https://www.care.ai)\n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      3. Three Common Forms of AI Surveillance in Medicine\n\n      3.1. Ambient AI Scribe: Recording, Transcribing, and Analyzing Conversations\n      \n        \n          Ambient AI Scribes are systems that record, transcribe, and analyze conversations between doctors and patients, \n          designed to automatically generate clinical notes to reduce documentation burden (2). \n          However, they have the ability to analyze tone, emotion, and language, \n          allowing hospitals to assess how often doctors deviate from professional guidelines or \n          detect “outliers” — those who spend too much time with patients compared to the “efficiency” standard (3).\n        \n        \n          The creation of “performance scores” by AI based on consultation time, protocol adherence, \n          or communication patterns could lead to doctors being ranked or monitored more strictly than ever before.\n        \n      \n\n      3.2. Analysis of Patient Messages in EHR: Measuring Empathy\n      \n        \n          AI tools can read, summarize, and respond to patient messages in the electronic health record (EHR) system \n          to help doctors triage and respond more quickly. However, they can also track \n          response time, tone, structure, and “empathy level” in each message.  \n          One study found that AI-generated responses were rated as “more empathetic” than those from real doctors (4).\n        \n        \n          As doctors' compensation and performance evaluations become increasingly tied to patient satisfaction, \n          the addition of an “emotional assessment” factor by AI could distort medical communication and decision-making — \n          making AI an invisible “judge” in the doctor-patient relationship.\n        \n      \n\n      3.3. Time Stamping and Legal Records\n      \n        \n          A notable precedent (5): in a spinal surgery with complications, \n          the EHR system automatically recorded long periods of no data entry, \n          contradicting the anesthesiologist's testimony that he had continuously monitored the patient. \n          As AI collects more detailed data, it can simultaneously help detect safety errors \n          and also have serious legal consequences for healthcare workers.\n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      4. Who is Most Vulnerable?\n      \n        According to the authors, all healthcare workers can be affected by AI surveillance, \n        but the most vulnerable group are those with less power in the organization — \n        such as residents, short-term contract doctors, or those new to the profession.  \n        They often have no say in the design and implementation of AI systems, \n        and are at risk of being evaluated or disciplined based on data they cannot verify or challenge.\n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        Illustrative image (Source: https://www.care.ai)\n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      5. Coping Strategies for Healthcare Workers\n\n      5.1. Technological Responses and Ethical Limits\n      \n        \n          In other industries, workers sometimes “disable” surveillance systems with tools like \n          “mouse jigglers” to simulate continuous activity (1). However, in a medical environment, \n          interfering with an AI system can directly affect patient safety and the legality of records.\n        \n      \n\n      5.2. The Power of Publicity and Social Criticism\n      \n        \n          In 2018, Amazon patented a haptic feedback wristband to monitor warehouse workers. \n          After being made public and facing a strong backlash from the public, the plan was canceled (1).  \n          Similarly, doctors can use the media and the public as an “ethical shield,” \n          demanding transparency and independent oversight of AI tools in hospitals.\n        \n      \n\n      5.3. Legal Mechanisms and Professional Rights\n      \n        \n          The authors emphasize the role of unions in opposing invasive forms of surveillance. \n          For example, the nurses' union at Kaiser Permanente has opposed the implementation of chatbots and other AI tools.  \n          In addition, the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) may allow doctors to refuse technology \n          that endangers the work environment. U.S. lawmakers are also discussing an \n          “AI Worker Bill of Rights” — which would clearly define the rights of workers in the age of AI (1).\n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      6. A Clinician's Bill of Rights for AI\n      \n        To protect the rights of the medical workforce, the authors propose a \n        “Clinician Bill of Rights for AI” with four main pillars:\n      \n      \n\n\n\nRight\nContent\n\n\n\n\nRight to Information\nDoctors must be informed when AI is used in patient care.\n\n\nRight to Participate\nHealthcare systems need transparent governance mechanisms that allow doctors to participate in decision-making.\n\n\nRight to Privacy\nDoctors need to know with whom and for what reason AI data about their activities is shared.\n\n\nQuality Assurance\nHigh-risk AI tools must be periodically evaluated, with the results transparently disclosed to doctors (1).\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n    \n      7. Conclusion\n      \n        AI opens up enormous potential in medicine — from supporting diagnosis and reducing errors to improving operational efficiency. \n        However, without a clear legal and ethical framework, \n        these tools can turn healthcare workers into “data subjects,” evaluated and controlled by the system.  \n        Establishing a boundary between support and control is a key factor in protecting the professional autonomy of doctors, \n        while ensuring patient safety and trust in the age of AI.\n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      8.

The Problem\n      \n        The interpretation of medical images is central to diagnostic practice, traditionally relying on the pattern recognition abilities and accumulated experience of physicians. \n        In the last decade, AI (especially deep learning) has made a leap in performance in many specialties: dermatology, cardiology (ECG), ophthalmology, \n        histopathology, chest X-ray, CT, MRI, and ultrasound1–5. \n        Although there are hundreds of clinical applications and many approved devices, the transition from “model evidence” to “clinical value” \n        still needs to overcome barriers of generalizability, interpretability, field evidence, and risk management6–14.\n      \n      \n        The NEJM article summarizes the progress, applications, clinical evidence, implementation challenges, and future prospects of AI in image interpretation, \n        emphasizing two main axes: (i) clinical and procedural efficiency (from lesion detection to emergency case prioritization – triage), \n        and (ii) technological foundation (from specialized models to multi-task, multi-modal foundation models).\n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n      \n      Image: Illustration of current applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of medical imaging, focusing on three main clinical functions: triage, detection, and diagnosis. Typical AI modules include CADt (computer-aided detection for triage), CADe (computer-aided detection for characterizing abnormalities), and CADx (computer-aided detection for diagnosis). In addition, AI is also used in image reconstruction and noise reduction processes to improve the quality of the output image. AI applications not directly related to medical imaging (non-imaging) are not presented in the figure. CT stands for computed tomography (Source: Rajpurkar P et al., 2023).\n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      2. The Role of AI in Medical Imaging\n      \n        AI provides support at multiple levels: preprocessing (noise reduction, CT/MR reconstruction, artifact correction), detection/segmentation (lesion detection/segmentation), \n        classification (benign/malignant, inflammatory/infectious…), quantification (volume, density, flow), and prediction (prognosis of events, treatment response)6–14. \n        At the system level, AI contributes to prioritizing urgent cases (e.g., intracranial hemorrhage, large vessel occlusion, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism), \n        classifying severity levels, and coordinating workflow11–14,20.\n      \n      \n        \n          Quantification & imaging biomarkers: measuring bone density, visceral fat, liver fat; quantifying brain structures, left ventricular function, coronary flow; supporting chronic risk assessment9–10.\n          Processing prioritization: triage models detect acute lesions to move them to the top of the reading list, shortening the time to intervention12,20.\n          Image quality improvement: deep learning for slice reconstruction and reduction of radiation dose/scan time while maintaining diagnostic quality9.\n          Clinical prediction: from image data, AI predicts progression (e.g., TBI, cancer) or guides novices in endoscopy/ultrasound to achieve acceptable diagnostic quality13–14.\n        \n      \n      \n        Many studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of human-machine collaboration: AI improves sensitivity/specificity, reduces reading time, and standardizes assessment; \n        at the same time, “AI-assisted – physician-decides” models often achieve higher levels of trust and effectiveness than AI operating independently16–20.\n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      3. Clinical and Systemic Benefits\n      \n        Clinically, AI can accelerate and improve the accuracy of diagnosis, detect small lesions, \n        reduce variability among physicians, and support the creation of structured reports. Systemically, AI helps prioritize urgent cases, \n        optimize workflow, allocate resources, and shorten the time to treatment11–14,20. \n        In some tasks, AI also predicts outcomes or suggests the need for additional tests/imaging, \n        moving towards personalized care pathways1–5,10.\n      \n\n      \n        \n          Reading efficiency & quality: assists physicians in detecting abnormalities (small pulmonary nodules, microcalcifications, microhemorrhages) and reduces omissions16–20.\n          Standardization of practice: reduces discrepancies between experts/units; increases the reproducibility of results16,19.\n          Support for resource-limited areas: handheld ultrasound/low-field MRI combined with AI expands diagnostic access at the primary care level10,14.\n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n      \n      Image: Validating the generalizability of AI systems in medical imaging. The three core components in validating the generalizability of AI systems in the field of medical imaging include (1) collaboration between physicians and AI, (2) transparency, and (3) post-deployment monitoring. First, physician-AI collaboration emphasizes the need to shift the focus of evaluation from solely considering the performance of the AI model operating independently to assessing the practical value of AI as a supportive tool in the actual clinical workflow. Second, transparency refers to the requirement to enhance the rigor of AI model information disclosure, through the application of checklists and the public release of medical imaging datasets for validation and research. Finally, post-deployment monitoring includes establishing mechanisms for receiving feedback from clinicians and applying a continual learning strategy to regularly update and calibrate the model, ensuring that AI maintains its effectiveness and safety in a real-world environment (Source: Rajpurkar P et al., 2023).\n    \n\n    \n    \n      4. Key Implementation Challenges\n      \n        \n          (i) Generalizability & dataset/domain shift. \n          A model's performance may decline when applied to different hospitals, scanners, populations, or protocols. \n          It is necessary to design multi-center trials, prospective/cluster-randomized trials, and domain adaptation/data standardization strategies6–8,15.\n        \n        \n          (ii) Transparency & explainability (black box). \n          The lack of transparency reduces trust and makes it difficult to integrate into clinical decision-making. Solutions include: \n          comprehensive reporting (dataset statements/model cards), local/global explanation methods, and UI design that emphasizes uncertainty16,21–22.\n        \n        \n          (iii) Lifecycle management & post-deployment drift. \n          Model performance changes over time due to changes in population/equipment/protocols. It is necessary to monitor performance, alert for drift, \n          update/retrain in a controlled manner, and conduct periodic audits23.\n        \n        \n          (iv) Data, fairness & privacy. \n          Data representativeness is a prerequisite to avoid bias. \n          Multi-center alliances, federated learning, and standardized metadata sharing help expand data while protecting privacy21–22.\n        \n        \n          (v) Regulation & evidence. \n          A legal framework is needed that reflects the specifics of AI/ML medical software, supports approval through a total product lifecycle, and allows for adaptive updates (“learning” devices), \n          while also requiring prospective clinical evidence of safety and effectiveness, not just AUROC in training6–8,23.\n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      5. Future Directions: Foundation & Multimodal AI\n      \n        Foundation models and multimodal AI are shifting the focus from “narrow-single-task” models \n        to generalist medical AI capable of simultaneously processing images, natural language (reports, EHR notes), and lab/vital data. \n        Self-supervised learning on large unlabeled data repositories helps extract rich representations, enhancing the effectiveness of “transfer learning” for specific clinical tasks24–25.\n      \n      \n        Combining large language models (LLMs) with medical vision allows for: \n        generating X-ray/CT/MRI reports in a standard style, explaining findings to patients, extracting tasks from clinical orders, \n        and supporting evidence-based reasoning. Recent studies show that LLMs encode significant clinical knowledge and can support decision-making, \n        provided they are rigorously validated and designed with a “human-in-the-loop”26–27.\n      \n      \n        The practical vision is an “AI collaborator” architecture where the model assists physicians in detection, report drafting, case prioritization, \n        risk prediction, and suggesting care pathways. Success depends on co-design with physicians/process experts, \n        transparency of data and models, and post-deployment monitoring according to quality standards.\n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n      \n      Image: The potential of generalist AI models in medical imaging. Generalist medical AI models offer enormous potential to comprehensively transform the field of medical imaging. These models are capable of generating complete diagnostic imaging reports, including clinical descriptions and interpretations synthesized from various data sources such as medical images, clinical context, and previous images. In addition, these models can link specific regions in an image to corresponding language descriptions, customize responses according to the user, and generate diagnostic results in a fully interpretive context, helping physicians better understand the clinical significance of the findings. Notably, these generalist models are also expected to be able to adapt flexibly to new practice environments and technologies, thereby maintaining effectiveness as imaging techniques or data change. In addition to image data, these models can integrate “omics” data (including genomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics), opening up new avenues for personalized diagnosis and treatment based on multi-layered biological data.

Application Recommendations for Vietnam\n      \n        \n          Priority applications with clear benefits: chest X-ray triage modules (pneumothorax, hemorrhage, PE), stroke detection on CT, support for primary care/mobile ultrasound; pilot implementation at central hospitals before expansion.\n          “AI made in Vietnam” model: train/fine-tune on Vietnamese data to increase generalizability; encourage multi-center alliances and federated learning to expand data while ensuring privacy22.\n          Data & legal standards: issue standard profiles (DICOM + standardized metadata), require transparent reporting (dataset/model cards), monitor drift, and have a lifecycle-based approval-update system23.\n          Training & operation: “AI for Radiologists & Sonographers” programs on reading results, understanding uncertainty, and human-machine decision-making; design UI/UX that displays case-level rationale.\n          Value measurement: clinical and operational outcome criteria (time to treatment, omission rate, reading capacity, cost), prospective/cluster-randomized trials instead of just comparing AUC.\n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      7. Conclusion\n      \n        AI in medical imaging is moving from single-task models to generalist multimodal platforms, \n        with growing evidence of clinical and systemic benefits. However, generalizability, \n        transparency, and post-deployment monitoring are prerequisites for achieving sustainable value. \n        Instead of replacing, AI acts as a “collaborator” that helps physicians reduce errors, standardize quality, and expand diagnostic access – \n        especially useful for resource-limited settings. With a suitable data-legal-training strategy, \n        Vietnam can “leapfrog” to leverage the AI wave for digital health transformation.\n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      8.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Medical tourism market in Vietnam:An analysis of the current situation and development potential\n\n    \n    \n      1. Introduction\n      \n        In recent decades, medical tourism and wellness tourism have become prominent trends in the global tourism industry. According to the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), this is one of six important development trends alongside ecotourism, community tourism, creative tourism, smart tourism, and responsible tourism. The global medical tourism market reached a scale of about 19 billion USD in 2018 and is forecast to increase to 30 billion USD by 2025 (Global Market Insights, 2019). Many Asian countries such as Thailand, Singapore, India, South Korea, and Malaysia have emerged as leading destinations thanks to a combination of supportive government policies, modern healthcare systems, developed tourism infrastructure, and well-built international brands (ITDR, 2020; Vietnam Briefing, 2023).\n      \n      \n        Medical tourism brings dual value: not only does it contribute directly to economic growth through revenue from medical and tourism services, but it also helps to improve the capacity of the domestic healthcare system through the process of quality standardization, international integration, and investment attraction. In addition, the development of medical tourism is also associated with building a national image and brand, contributing to enhancing its position on the regional and global healthcare map.\n      \n      \n        In Vietnam, medical tourism is in its early stages of development but has recorded positive signals. Each year, about 300,000 international visitors come to Vietnam for medical examination and treatment, bringing in an estimated revenue of 1–2 billion USD (VietnamPlus, 2025; Ministry of Health, 2025). However, this number is still modest compared to the potential. Meanwhile, the opposite trend of medical outbound is still very large, with about 60,000 Vietnamese people going abroad for treatment each year, spending about 2 billion USD (ITDR, 2020). A comparison of international medical costs shows Vietnam's clear competitive advantage: a spinal surgery costs only about 7,000 USD, much lower than in the US (110,000 USD), South Korea (23,000 USD), or India (12,000 USD) (Economics & Forecasting Review, 2025).\n      \n      \n        In that context, research on medical tourism in Vietnam is of great significance, aiming to:\n      \n      \n        Analyze the current market situation, including scale, trends, and strong medical specialties\n        Assess the potential, advantages, opportunities, and challenges in developing medical tourism\n        Propose strategic recommendations to develop this field in a professional, sustainable, and internationally integrated manner, contributing to making Vietnam a reputable healthcare destination in the region\n      \n\n      \n      \n        \n          \n        \n        \n          An Indonesian patient with rectal cancer was treated at the University of Medicine and Pharmacy Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City in July 2024. (Photo: VNA)\n        \n      \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n      2. Theoretical basis and analytical framework\n      2.1. Concepts and classification\n      \n        Medical tourism is defined as the act of people traveling abroad to use medical examination and treatment services, surgery, dentistry, cosmetology, or advanced medical techniques at a reasonable cost and with guaranteed quality.\n      \n      \n        Wellness tourism emphasizes resort services, spas, yoga, meditation, traditional therapies, and activities to improve physical and mental health.\n      \n      \n        Some specific sub-branches have been identified, including reproductive tourism, cosmetic surgery tourism, dental tourism, or specialized treatment tourism (such as cardiology, oncology, organ transplantation).\n      \n      \n        This classification allows for a clearer identification of the needs and motivations of international customers, and at the same time helps to build medical-tourism service packages suitable for each market segment.\n      \n      \n      2.2. Determinants of development\n      \n        The success of the medical tourism industry depends on many factors:\n      \n      \n        Healthcare system and service quality: including the professional qualifications of the medical team, access to advanced medical techniques, and obtaining international quality certificates (e.g., JCI). Vietnam currently has only 4 JCI-accredited hospitals, much lower than Thailand (67 hospitals).\n        Treatment costs and international comparison: this is a core competitive advantage. Vietnam has much lower medical costs than developed countries (e.g., spinal surgery ~7,000 USD in Vietnam compared to 110,000 USD in the US).\n        Tourism & transportation infrastructure: including the system of international airports, hotels, resorts, convenient transportation, as well as patient support services (interpreters, post-treatment care).\n        Government policies and international cooperation: national strategies and resolutions (such as Resolution 59-NQ/TW 2025, Decision 147/QD-TTg 2020, Ministry of Health's 2023–2030 projects) emphasize making medical tourism a key economic sector. Bilateral and multilateral cooperation, along with the participation of the private sector, also plays an important role.\n      \n\n      2.3. Analytical framework\n      To comprehensively assess the current situation and potential of the Vietnamese medical tourism market, the study can apply the following strategic analysis tools:\n      \n        SWOT (Strengths – Weaknesses – Opportunities – Threats): to identify competitive advantages (cost, human resources, traditional medicine), weaknesses (lack of international brand, inconsistent infrastructure), opportunities (post-COVID-19 demand, global wellness trend), and challenges (regional competition, international standardization requirements).\n        PESTEL (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, Legal): to analyze the macroeconomic context affecting the industry, from national policies, economic trends, social-demographic changes, advances in medical-digital technology, to environmental factors and the legal framework.\n        Porter’s Five Forces Model: to assess the pressure from competitors (Thailand, Singapore, India, South Korea), the threat of substitutes (Vietnamese outbound patients going abroad), the bargaining power of international customers, medical-tourism service providers, and barriers to entry for new businesses.\n      \n      The combination of these three analytical frameworks will create a solid foundation for assessing the current situation, potential, and strategic direction for the development of medical tourism in Vietnam in the period 2025–2035.\n\n      \n      \n        \n          \n        \n        \n          Doctors at Saint Paul General Hospital in Hanoi perform surgery to treat a choledochal cyst for a 4-year-old Australian pediatric patient on December 5, 2023.

Scale and trends\n      \n        International visitors to Vietnam for treatment: According to the Ministry of Health, each year Vietnam receives about 300,000 foreign visitors for medical examination and treatment, mainly concentrated in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi (VietnamPlus 2025). Revenue is estimated at 1–2 billion USD/year (Vietnam Briefing 2023).\n        Vietnamese going abroad for treatment (outbound): About 60,000 Vietnamese go abroad for medical treatment annually, spending 2–3 billion USD (ITDR 2020). This shows a large \"foreign currency drain\" due to trust in the international healthcare system.\n        Market growth: In 2024, the size of the Vietnamese medical tourism market reached 722.3 million USD, expected to increase to 3.7 billion USD by 2033 with a CAGR of 17.8% (2025–2033) (IMARC 2025).\n        Customer trends: Foreigners coming to Vietnam are mainly from the ASEAN region, Australia, South Korea, Japan, and overseas Vietnamese. They are interested in dental, cosmetic, IVF, minimally invasive surgery, and traditional medicine services.\n      \n\n      \n      \n        \n          \n        \n        \n          A Cambodian patient with Whitmore's disease recovers after three weeks of intensive treatment at City International Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City in June 2025. (Photo: VNA)\n        \n      \n\n      4.2. Prominent medical specialties\n      \n        Dentistry & aesthetics: Ho Chi Minh City is a leading dental service center, with costs much cheaper than Australia and the US (only 1/3 – 1/4) (ITDR 2020). Aesthetics and dermatology are also developing, with the Ho Chi Minh City Dermatology Hospital trusted by many international clients (VietnamPlus 2025).\n        Obstetrics & gynecology & infertility: Vietnam performs about 30,000 IVF cases annually, leading ASEAN (ITDR 2020). Complex surgeries such as fetal cardiac intervention (Tu Du Hospital & Children's Hospital 1, 2, 2025) have gained international recognition.\n        Cardiology, oncology, complex surgery: Viet Duc, Bach Mai, Cho Ray, 108 hospitals have received many failed cases from Europe, Japan, Australia and treated them successfully (VietnamPlus 2025).\n        Traditional medicine, rehabilitation, wellness: Vietnam has an advantage in rich medicinal resources, acupuncture, and physiotherapy. The Ho Chi Minh City Institute of Traditional Medicine has implemented a model combining treatment and resort, but its effectiveness is still limited due to the lack of all-inclusive service packages (VietnamPlus 2025).\n      \n\n      \n      \n        \n          \n        \n        \n          Vietnam possesses a rich source of medicinal materials and traditional medicine, creating great potential for the development of medical tourism.

International comparison\n      \n        \n          Treatment costs:\n          \n            Spinal surgery: US ~110,000 USD; South Korea ~23,000 USD; India ~12,000 USD; Vietnam ~7,000 USD (Economics & Forecasting Review 2025).\n            Heart surgery: Vietnam 10,000–15,000 USD, much lower than Thailand (25,000–30,000 USD) (Vietnam Briefing 2023).\n          \n        \n        \n          International certification: Vietnam has only 4 JCI-accredited hospitals (Vinmec, FV, Hoan My, Hong Ngoc), much lower than Thailand (67 hospitals). This is a major barrier in terms of brand and reliability.\n        \n        \n          Competitive destinations: Thailand, Singapore, and India have advantages in global marketing, strong support policies, and specialized services. However, Vietnam has the advantage of low costs and skilled medical human resources.\n        \n      \n\n      4.4. National policies and strategies\n      \n        \n          Resolution 59-NQ/TW (2025): identifies medical tourism as a potential field for development in international integration.\n        \n        \n          Resolution 153/NQ-CP (2025): implements a project to develop internationally standardized specialized medical centers.\n        \n        \n          Vietnam Tourism Development Strategy to 2030: prioritizes health tourism, spas, mineral springs, and traditional medicine services.\n        \n        \n          Ministry of Health's 2025–2030 project: aims to have at least 15 internationally accredited hospitals by 2030, including 5 public hospitals; build combined medical-tourism service packages.\n        \n        \n          Inter-sectoral cooperation: The Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Culture, Sports & Tourism signed an MOU (2025) to promote cooperation, promotion, and the building of integrated medical-tourism products.\n        \n      \n\n            \n      \n        \n          \n        \n        \n          The Vietnam Tourism Development Strategy to 2030 particularly emphasizes the development of high-quality, diverse, and unique tourism products, with priority given to tourism associated with healthcare.

(2022): BI plays a central role in the digital transformation of healthcare.\n          Mansoor & Dar (2024): The application of BI helps optimize the management of clinical testing processes.\n        \n      \n\n      \n        Therefore, it is necessary to develop an academic and practical handbook to guide data processing and analysis for the community, \n        combining theory, tools, methods, and practical illustrations.\n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        Illustration (Source: Internet)\n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      2.
