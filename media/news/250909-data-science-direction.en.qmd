      <h2>1. General Introduction</h2>
      <p><strong>New Directions in Biomedical Research: Data Science Shapes the Future of Healthcare</strong></p>
      <p>
        Biomedical data science is becoming the foundation of modern medical breakthroughs — 
        not through overly complex technologies, but by effectively harnessing the data already available in the healthcare system. 
        New research directions focus on integrating multi-source data, 
        building evidence from clinical practice, 
        developing digital biomarkers, 
        and applying predictive analytics to improve treatment outcomes. 
        These advances are creating significant changes in healthcare.

      </p>

      <p>
        Multimodal data integration is revolutionizing how we understand patient health, 
        by combining different data sources such as medical imaging, electronic health records, genomic data, 
        and information from wearable devices. This approach provides a multidimensional view of the patient's condition, 
        enhancing the ability to diagnose, treat, and manage diseases.

      <p>
        In oncology, multimodal data allows for more accurate tumor characterization 
        and supports the development of personalized treatment plans. 
        One study showed that combining these data types can accurately predict treatment response with 
        Anti–Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (Anti-HER2) with an AUC = 0.91. 
        In ophthalmology, integrating genetic and imaging data helps in the early detection of retinal diseases.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, multimodal data integration still faces many challenges, 
        such as inconsistency in collection, incomplete or erroneous data that reduces the reliability of the model. 
        To be effective, data standardization, rigorous preprocessing, and interdisciplinary validation are needed 
        to ensure the quality of predictive analysis.

      <h2>3. Real-World Evidence: From Clinical Trials to Practice</h2>
      <p>
        <em>Manfred Stapff. The Importance of Real-World Evidence in Medical Research and Drug Development. 
        Applied Clinical Trials. 2025.<br>

        doi: 10.1007/s40290-022-00456-6. PMID: 36604368; PMCID: PMC9815890.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Real-World Evidence (RWE) represents a shift in medical research: 
        from relying solely on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to harnessing data from everyday healthcare practice. 
        RWE is scientific evidence on the safety and effectiveness of a medical product, 
        generated from Real-World Data (RWD) – data collected during routine care.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sources of RWD include electronic health records (EHRs), registries, insurance data, 
        and data from personal health applications or devices. 
        A study comparing the effectiveness of multiple myeloma treatment between clinical trials and real-world data showed that: 
        patients in RWD were often older, and the results indicated that 6 out of 7 real-world treatment regimens 
        had a 1.44 times lower progression-free survival and a 1.75 times lower overall survival compared to the corresponding RCTs.
      </p>

      <p>
        RWE has the potential to fill research gaps, especially for rare diseases, 
        where many patients cannot participate in traditional trials. 
        In addition, RWE supports health policy planning, resource allocation, 
        and evaluation of treatment effectiveness in a real-world setting, 
        contributing to reducing health inequalities.

      </p>

      <p>
        In modern medicine, biomarkers are indispensable tools for assessing health status. 
        The development of digital devices and mobile applications has created a new generation – digital biomarkers, 
        providing continuous, objective, and personalized data like never before.
      </p>

      <figure>

        </div>
        <figcaption>
          Image: Digital technologies have enabled the measurement of digital biomarkers. Traditional biomarkers are divided into seven groups depending on the clinical goal (e.g., safety, predictive, diagnostic, etc.). The study suggests that digital technologies open up the possibility of measuring digital biomarkers, which offer new and unique properties (such as continuous measurement over time) while still addressing the same clinical goals as traditional biomarkers. (Source: Babrak LM, Menetski J, Rebhan M, Nisato G, Zinggeler M, Brasier N, Baerenfaller K, Brenzikofer T, Baltzer L, Vogler C, Gschwind L, Schneider C, Streiff F, Groenen PMA, Miho E.

        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Traditional biomarkers include indicators such as cholesterol, blood pressure, BMI... 
        Meanwhile, digital biomarkers are defined as “objective, quantifiable physiological and behavioral measures 
        collected and measured by means of digital devices that are portable, wearable, implantable, or digestible.” 
        The key difference is the ability for continuous monitoring, which helps in the early detection of health changes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Digital biomarkers have shown potential in many areas:
        detecting the risk of dementia through computerized cognitive tests,
        monitoring movement in Huntington's disease,
        and assessing Parkinson's symptoms through a finger-tapping test on a smartphone.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite their great potential, this field still faces challenges in standardizing definitions, 
        data security, and a slow approval process – which need to be improved to expand clinical applications.

      <p>
        AI-driven Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) are revolutionizing the medical decision-making process, 
        thanks to their ability to analyze complex data and identify hidden patterns.  
        In diagnostic imaging, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved performance comparable to experts 
        in skin cancer classification (Esteva et al.).  
        In cardiovascular risk prediction, deep learning models using EHRs help identify high-risk patients early, 
        allowing for early intervention and prevention of complications.

      <h2>6. Challenges and Development Opportunities</h2>
      <p>
        Besides progress, the field of biomedical data science faces major challenges:  
        data security and privacy; system compatibility between hospitals, 
        especially with older infrastructure; and the slow pace of technology adoption in some healthcare facilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, the development opportunities in Vietnam are enormous. 
        With a population of over 100 million, Vietnam possesses a valuable source of medical data for training AI models. 
        The government is promoting digital transformation in healthcare, 
        with a National Data Development Fund worth 1,000 billion VND (2025) — 
        a significant step to promote innovation and AI application in medicine.

        New research directions in biomedical data science demonstrate a practical, effective, and patient-oriented approach.  
        From integrating multi-source data to real-world evidence, from digital biomarkers to intelligent decision support systems —  
        all are aimed at the common goal: improving treatment quality, reducing costs, and promoting personalized medicine in the data era.
