          <strong>The BIODAS Team</strong> is pleased to introduce and share the content of this research with you, 
          to provide a deeper insight into the 
          <strong>trust, behavior, and relationship between patients – AI – doctors</strong> in the digital medical era. 
          Let's explore the interesting findings from this work in more detail with the <strong>BIODAS Team</strong>.

    <!-- 1. Introduction -->
    <section id="sec-1">
      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is no longer a foreign concept, but how it is implemented and the level of patient acceptance remain open questions. Although AI has been studied in healthcare since the 1970s, the real boom has only occurred in the last few decades with the potential to improve prognosis, reduce costs, and enhance the quality of care for both doctors and patients. As a multidisciplinary field, AI is gradually becoming a pillar of a patient-centered healthcare system.
      </p>
      <p>
        For cancer patients, specific challenges include the lack of continuous personalized care, and patients often experience anxiety and uncertainty. These anxieties are further exacerbated in linguistic, ethnic, and racial minority groups - vulnerable communities in society. AI applications have shown positive results in mitigating these challenges while aiming to improve quality of life. However, the level of acceptance and adoption of AI by cancer patients is still not well understood.

      <h2>2. Research Methods</h2>
      <p>
        The study <em>“Acceptance and Adoption of Artificial Intelligence Among Cancer Survivors Seeking Information: A Literature Review”</em> by Prabal Chourasia et al. (2025), published in the <em>Journal of Patient Experience</em>, conducted a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines on three main databases: PubMed, Scopus, and CINAHL Plus with Full Text.
      </p>
      <div class="callout">
        <p><strong>Inclusion criteria:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Studies surveying people aged 18–99;</li>
          <li>Focusing on cancer patients;</li>
          <li>Assessing the acceptance or adoption of AI in seeking medical information;</li>
          <li>Being original research.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="callout">
        <p><strong>Exclusion criteria:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Special patient populations (children, pregnant women...);</li>
          <li>Studies focusing on service providers instead of patients;</li>
          <li>Studies not about cancer patients or just conference abstracts.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
        The analysis process used a combination of inductive and deductive methods to identify factors of trust in AI, the usability of AI tools, and the role of personalization.
