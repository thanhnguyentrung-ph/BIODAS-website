    <h1 class="title">Medical tourism market in Vietnam:<br>An analysis of the current situation and development potential</h1>

    <!-- 1. Introduction -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        In recent decades, medical tourism and wellness tourism have become prominent trends in the global tourism industry. According to the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), this is one of six important development trends alongside ecotourism, community tourism, creative tourism, smart tourism, and responsible tourism. The global medical tourism market reached a scale of about 19 billion USD in 2018 and is forecast to increase to 30 billion USD by 2025 (Global Market Insights, 2019). Many Asian countries such as Thailand, Singapore, India, South Korea, and Malaysia have emerged as leading destinations thanks to a combination of supportive government policies, modern healthcare systems, developed tourism infrastructure, and well-built international brands (ITDR, 2020; Vietnam Briefing, 2023).
      </p>
      <p>
        Medical tourism brings dual value: not only does it contribute directly to economic growth through revenue from medical and tourism services, but it also helps to improve the capacity of the domestic healthcare system through the process of quality standardization, international integration, and investment attraction. In addition, the development of medical tourism is also associated with building a national image and brand, contributing to enhancing its position on the regional and global healthcare map.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Vietnam, medical tourism is in its early stages of development but has recorded positive signals. Each year, about 300,000 international visitors come to Vietnam for medical examination and treatment, bringing in an estimated revenue of 1–2 billion USD (VietnamPlus, 2025; Ministry of Health, 2025). However, this number is still modest compared to the potential. Meanwhile, the opposite trend of medical outbound is still very large, with about 60,000 Vietnamese people going abroad for treatment each year, spending about 2 billion USD (ITDR, 2020). A comparison of international medical costs shows Vietnam's clear competitive advantage: a spinal surgery costs only about 7,000 USD, much lower than in the US (110,000 USD), South Korea (23,000 USD), or India (12,000 USD) (Economics & Forecasting Review, 2025).
      </p>
      <p>
        In that context, research on medical tourism in Vietnam is of great significance, aiming to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Analyze the current market situation, including scale, trends, and strong medical specialties</li>
        <li>Assess the potential, advantages, opportunities, and challenges in developing medical tourism</li>
        <li>Propose strategic recommendations to develop this field in a professional, sustainable, and internationally integrated manner, contributing to making Vietnam a reputable healthcare destination in the region</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- 2. Theoretical basis and analytical framework -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>2. Theoretical basis and analytical framework</h2>
      <h3>2.1. Concepts and classification</h3>
      <p>
        Medical tourism is defined as the act of people traveling abroad to use medical examination and treatment services, surgery, dentistry, cosmetology, or advanced medical techniques at a reasonable cost and with guaranteed quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wellness tourism emphasizes resort services, spas, yoga, meditation, traditional therapies, and activities to improve physical and mental health.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some specific sub-branches have been identified, including reproductive tourism, cosmetic surgery tourism, dental tourism, or specialized treatment tourism (such as cardiology, oncology, organ transplantation).
      </p>
      <p>
        This classification allows for a clearer identification of the needs and motivations of international customers, and at the same time helps to build medical-tourism service packages suitable for each market segment.
      </p>
      
      <h3>2.2. Determinants of development</h3>
      <p>
        The success of the medical tourism industry depends on many factors:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Healthcare system and service quality: including the professional qualifications of the medical team, access to advanced medical techniques, and obtaining international quality certificates (e.g., JCI). Vietnam currently has only 4 JCI-accredited hospitals, much lower than Thailand (67 hospitals).</li>
        <li>Treatment costs and international comparison: this is a core competitive advantage. Vietnam has much lower medical costs than developed countries (e.g., spinal surgery ~7,000 USD in Vietnam compared to 110,000 USD in the US).</li>
        <li>Tourism & transportation infrastructure: including the system of international airports, hotels, resorts, convenient transportation, as well as patient support services (interpreters, post-treatment care).</li>
        <li>Government policies and international cooperation: national strategies and resolutions (such as Resolution 59-NQ/TW 2025, Decision 147/QD-TTg 2020, Ministry of Health's 2023–2030 projects) emphasize making medical tourism a key economic sector. Bilateral and multilateral cooperation, along with the participation of the private sector, also plays an important role.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.3. Analytical framework</h3>
      <p>To comprehensively assess the current situation and potential of the Vietnamese medical tourism market, the study can apply the following strategic analysis tools:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>SWOT (Strengths – Weaknesses – Opportunities – Threats): to identify competitive advantages (cost, human resources, traditional medicine), weaknesses (lack of international brand, inconsistent infrastructure), opportunities (post-COVID-19 demand, global wellness trend), and challenges (regional competition, international standardization requirements).</li>
        <li>PESTEL (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, Legal): to analyze the macroeconomic context affecting the industry, from national policies, economic trends, social-demographic changes, advances in medical-digital technology, to environmental factors and the legal framework.</li>
        <li>Porter’s Five Forces Model: to assess the pressure from competitors (Thailand, Singapore, India, South Korea), the threat of substitutes (Vietnamese outbound patients going abroad), the bargaining power of international customers, medical-tourism service providers, and barriers to entry for new businesses.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The combination of these three analytical frameworks will create a solid foundation for assessing the current situation, potential, and strategic direction for the development of medical tourism in Vietnam in the period 2025–2035.</p>

    <!-- 4. Current situation of medical tourism in Vietnam -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>4. Current situation of medical tourism in Vietnam</h2>
      <h3>4.1. Scale and trends</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>International visitors to Vietnam for treatment: According to the Ministry of Health, each year Vietnam receives about 300,000 foreign visitors for medical examination and treatment, mainly concentrated in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi (VietnamPlus 2025). Revenue is estimated at 1–2 billion USD/year (Vietnam Briefing 2023).</li>
        <li>Vietnamese going abroad for treatment (outbound): About 60,000 Vietnamese go abroad for medical treatment annually, spending 2–3 billion USD (ITDR 2020). This shows a large "foreign currency drain" due to trust in the international healthcare system.</li>
        <li>Market growth: In 2024, the size of the Vietnamese medical tourism market reached 722.3 million USD, expected to increase to 3.7 billion USD by 2033 with a CAGR of 17.8% (2025–2033) (IMARC 2025).</li>
        <li>Customer trends: Foreigners coming to Vietnam are mainly from the ASEAN region, Australia, South Korea, Japan, and overseas Vietnamese. They are interested in dental, cosmetic, IVF, minimally invasive surgery, and traditional medicine services.</li>
      </ul>

      </figure>

      <h3>4.2. Prominent medical specialties</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Dentistry & aesthetics: Ho Chi Minh City is a leading dental service center, with costs much cheaper than Australia and the US (only 1/3 – 1/4) (ITDR 2020). Aesthetics and dermatology are also developing, with the Ho Chi Minh City Dermatology Hospital trusted by many international clients (VietnamPlus 2025).</li>
        <li>Obstetrics & gynecology & infertility: Vietnam performs about 30,000 IVF cases annually, leading ASEAN (ITDR 2020). Complex surgeries such as fetal cardiac intervention (Tu Du Hospital & Children's Hospital 1, 2, 2025) have gained international recognition.</li>
        <li>Cardiology, oncology, complex surgery: Viet Duc, Bach Mai, Cho Ray, 108 hospitals have received many failed cases from Europe, Japan, Australia and treated them successfully (VietnamPlus 2025).</li>
        <li>Traditional medicine, rehabilitation, wellness: Vietnam has an advantage in rich medicinal resources, acupuncture, and physiotherapy. The Ho Chi Minh City Institute of Traditional Medicine has implemented a model combining treatment and resort, but its effectiveness is still limited due to the lack of all-inclusive service packages (VietnamPlus 2025).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4.3. International comparison</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Treatment costs:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Spinal surgery: US ~110,000 USD; South Korea ~23,000 USD; India ~12,000 USD; Vietnam ~7,000 USD (Economics & Forecasting Review 2025).</li>
            <li>Heart surgery: Vietnam 10,000–15,000 USD, much lower than Thailand (25,000–30,000 USD) (Vietnam Briefing 2023).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>International certification:</strong> Vietnam has only 4 JCI-accredited hospitals (Vinmec, FV, Hoan My, Hong Ngoc), much lower than Thailand (67 hospitals). This is a major barrier in terms of brand and reliability.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Competitive destinations:</strong> Thailand, Singapore, and India have advantages in global marketing, strong support policies, and specialized services. However, Vietnam has the advantage of low costs and skilled medical human resources.
        </li>
      </ul>
