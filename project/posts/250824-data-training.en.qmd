      <h2>1. Background and Rationale</h2>
      <p>
        In the context of digital transformation, data is increasingly regarded as a strategic resource. The effective use of data plays a central role in policy design and implementation, social governance, and sustainable development. International organizations such as FAO, ESCAP, and the UN have repeatedly emphasized the importance of data capacity in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the current situation in many developing countries, including Vietnam, shows a significant lack of skills in data processing and analysis within the community. Many officials, students, and social organizations only have basic access (e.g., basic Excel), while lacking the ability to use more modern tools (Power BI, R, Python, Quarto). This limits the ability to make evidence-based decisions and apply data in local governance.
      </p>

      <div class="callout">
        <p><strong>Key international indicators:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Mačiulienė &amp; Skaržauskienė (2019):</strong> civic tech communities 
            can only develop sustainably when they integrate three pillars: technology, knowledge, and people.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>FAO (2020):</strong> in a project in Papua New Guinea emphasized that the lack of baseline data 
            hindered the development of agricultural policy; continuous training, a standardized data framework, 
            and the application of simple technology (CAPI, GIS) brought about a breakthrough.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>ESCAP (2025):</strong> affirms that digital data governance 
            is a key factor in promoting the SDGs, and requires the active participation of the community.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>
        From these gaps, the implementation of the project "Building a foundation for community data processing and analysis capacity" is both an urgent and long-term requirement in the process of building a digital society in Vietnam.

        <h3>Theoretical Basis</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Civic tech &amp; digital data analytics framework</strong> (Mačiulienė &amp; Skaržauskienė, 2019):
            three main networks – <em>Tech/Media</em>, <em>Knowledge</em>, and <em>Human</em> – are the basis for understanding how
            communities interact and develop data capacity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Community capacity</strong> (Liberato et al., 2011):
            includes skills development, resource mobilization, network building, leadership, and participatory decision-making;
            can be adapted to measure data capacity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Papua New Guinea experience</strong> (FAO, 2020):
            emphasizes the role of baseline data, simple but effective technology, and continuous training
            in enhancing national data capacity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Digital data governance</strong> (ESCAP, 2025):
            requires data to be governed transparently, accountably, and sustainably, directly linked to the SDGs.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="card" style="margin-top:14px;">

      <h2>5. Approach</h2>

      <div class="callout">
        <h3>Mixed-Methods Approach</h3>
        <p>
          Combines quantitative surveys (measuring data capacity before and after intervention) and qualitative methods
          (interviews, group discussions) to both quantify the level of change and explain the mechanisms and context of the impact.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="callout" style="margin-top:14px;">
        <h3>Implementation Activities</h3>
        <p>
          Implement the <em>Community Data Labs</em> model in a test-evaluate-adjust cycle,
          ensuring continuous improvement based on experimental feedback from learners and the community.
